# Bowling Challenge

This is my attempt at the [Makers Academy Week 5 Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/bowling-challenge)

## Approach

Having spent a lot of time trying to come to a solution myself, I used the walkthrough from [this website](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata)

I built the bowling scorer was built in Javascript using TDD with Jasmine.

run ```open Specrunner.html``` to run tests in browser.
